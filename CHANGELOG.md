## [0.7.1] - 2026-03-28

### Fixed

- **Dashboard Prompt Viewer**:
  - Prompt Viewer Messages tab showing empty `[user]` entries for CLI driver processes — seed initial intent as first user message and skip nil-content user events from CLI drivers
  - Prompt Viewer Tools tab showing `Tools (0)` for CLI driver processes — build tool definitions from tool_call events as fallback when system event doesn't include tools
  - Prompt Viewer Tools tab showing incomplete tool info — now displays step-level tool details: name, description, path, input, result, duration from StepRecord
  - StepRecord Action field incorrectly set to `"tool_call"` instead of actual tool name
  - StepRecord missing ToolResult and ToolInput for CLI driver processes
  - Cursor CLI driver not extracting full tool args and result from tool_call events
  - `extractContentText` not handling `map[string]any` and `string` content formats for assistant/user events
  - `tool_result` content in `[]any` format not being parsed for text extraction
